# OpenCV Image Filter Test

A test of an image filter for the [Blossom Cam](https://github.com/BrandonDuncan13/BlossomCam) project.

## Setup and Run

I used [this](https://youtu.be/m9HBM1m_EMU) tutorial on youtube to setup the project. To run it, make sure the paths are changed to be actual image paths.

## Notes

The file "filter_image_v0.hpp" is the original image filter.
